# PlanetsLib

Code, graphics and conventions to help modders creating planets, moons and other systems. This library is a community project and will grow over time. Feel free to contribute via pull requests on [Github](https://github.com/danielmartin0/PlanetsLib).

We try to avoid breaking changes. In the unlikely event breaking changes occur, the major version of Planetslib will be bumped (unless the feature is unused.)

## API Reference

### Planet helpers

* `PlanetsLib:extend(config)` — A wrapper/replacement for `data:extend`. Throws an error if passed `distance` or `orientation`. It instead takes the fields listed below.
    * `type` — `"planet"` or `"space-location"`
    * `orbit` — Object containing orbital parameters:
        * `parent` — Object containing `name` and `type` fields, corresponding to a parent at `data.raw[type][name]`. Planets in the original solar system should have an orbit with `type = "space-location"` and `name = "star"`.
        * `distance` — Number: orbital distance from parent
        * `orientation` — Number: orbital angle from parent (0-1). Note that orientation is absolute, not relative to the parent's orientation.
        * `sprite` — Object: Sprite for the orbit, centered on its parent
    * `sprite_only` — Boolean (optional): If true, this prototype will be removed in `data-final-fixes` and replaced by its sprites on the starmap (unless neither `starmap_icon`, `starmap_icons` nor an orbit sprite are defined, in which case nothing will show).
        * This is useful for constructing stars and other locations that should not have a space platform 'docking ring'.
    * Other valid `planet` or `space-location` prototype fields
    * Further notes on `PlanetsLib:extend`:
        * Should not be called in `data-final-fixes`.
        * See [here](https://github.com/danielmartin0/Cerys-Moon-of-Fulgora/blob/main/prototypes/planet/planet.lua) or [here](https://github.com/danielmartin0/PlanetsLib/issues/12#issuecomment-2585484116) for usage examples.
* `PlanetsLib:update(config)` — The same as `PlanetsLib:extend`, except it updates a pre-existing planet or space location (identified by the passed `type` and `name` fields) using the parameters passed. If the `orbit` field is passed, the `distance` and `orientation` fields on the prototype will be updated appropriately. Should not be called in `data-final-fixes`.
* `PlanetsLib:borrow_music(source_planet, target_planet)` - Clones music tracks from an existing planet to a new one.
* `PlanetsLib:set_default_import_location(item_name, planet)` - Sets the default import location for an item on a planet.

### Planet Cargo Drops Technology

The library provides automatic functionality to restrict cargo drops on your planet until a technology is researched. To implement:

* Define a technology with name pattern: `[planet-name]-cargo-drops`
    * Use the provided helper functions:
    * `PlanetsLib.technology_icons_planet_cargo_drops`
    * `PlanetsLib.technology_effect_cargo_drops`

Players will be unable to drop cargo (excluding players and construction robots) to planets with that name before researching the technology.

## Support for moons

* `PlanetsLib.technology_icons_moon` — Standardized icon for moon discovery technology.
* `subgroup=satellites` — A new Factoriopedia row for satellites (below the planets row).

### Description templates

PlanetsLib provides a set of localisation templates for moons and planets to provide standardization between mods on how the relationships between planets and moons are described.

```
[planetslib-templates] 
moon-description=__1__\nOrbiting __2__.
planet-description-one-moon=__1__\nOrbited by __2__.
planet-description-two-moons=__1__\nOrbited by __2__ and __3__.
planet-description-three-moons=__1__\nOrbited by __2__, __3__, and __4__.
```

### Description examples
```
data.raw["planet"]["muluna"].localised_description={"planetslib-templates.moon-description",{"space-location-description.muluna"},"[planet=nauvis]"}
data.raw["planet"]["nauvis"].localised_description={"planetslib-templates.planet-description-one-moon",{"space-location-description.nauvis"},"[planet=muluna]"}
data.raw["planet"]["nauvis"].localised_description={"planetslib-templates.planet-description-two-moons",{"space-location-description.nauvis"},"[planet=muluna]","[planet=lignumis]"}
```

## Surface conditions

### Surface condition helpers

* `PlanetsLib.restrict_to_surface(planet)` : Returns surface condition restricting an entity to the provided planet(See `planet-str`).
* `PlanetsLib.exact_value(property,value)` : Returns surface condition that requires the planet's `property` equal `value`.

#### Example
```
local muluna = data.raw["planet"]["muluna"]
anorthite_crushing.surface_conditions ={
    -- Add more surface conditions here
    PlanetsLib.exact_value("oxygen",0), -- Requires exactly 0% oxygen.
    PlanetsLib.restrict_to_surface(muluna), -- Explicitly locks recipe to Muluna. This condition is hidden in-game.
}
```
### New conditions

PlanetsLib includes a wide variety of surface conditions, all of which are either hidden or disabled by default. To enable a surface condition, modders must add the following line to settings-updates.lua:

`data.raw["bool-setting"]["PlanetsLib-enable-[PROPERTY]"].forced_value = true`

Example: `data.raw["bool-setting"]["PlanetsLib-enable-oxygen"].forced_value = true`

### New conditions with quantity format
* `temperature`: __n__ K
* Atmospheric Gases
  * `oxygen`: __n__%
  * `nitrogen`: __n__%
  * `carbon-dioxide`: __n__%
  * `argon`: __n__%

### Hidden conditions

The following conditions are hidden but always enabled. 

* `planet-str` - A string (<=8 characters) encoded as a double and stored in a planet's surface properties. Setting this from a string can be inconvenient, so the following functions are included to help modders encode strings into a planet's properties, then decode the resulting double back into a string. Every planet should have a unique planet-str to have the intended effect. Restricting a recipe to a particular planet-str makes it possible to explicitly restrict recipes and buildings to a single planet. In most situations, mods other than PlanetsLib will not need to use these functions.
  * `PlanetsLib.planet_str.set_planet_str(planet)` : Sets the planet string of a planet. This is done automatically for all planets, but these default strings can be overidden. If two planets share the first 8 character names, they will have the same planet string, so one of them should be manually changed to a different string if the modder doesn't want conditions to apply to both planets.
  * `PlanetsLib.planet_str.get_planet_str(planet) -> str` : Returns the planet string of a planet, decoded from double to string. Not used very often in practice.
  * `PlanetsLib.planet_str.get_planet_str_double(planet)` : Returns the planet string of a planet as a double. If the planet string has not been set yet, it will return the planet string that the planet will have by the end of data-final-fixes.lua. This function is used internally when setting the surface conditions of a recipe or entity.
* `parent-body` - A planet-str referencing the planet's parent planet. Used by moons to indicate their parent body. Automatically defined when a body's parent is defined as a planet.
