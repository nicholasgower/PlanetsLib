# Todo List

## Significant

- @danielmartin0: Settings for the rotation of planets. By default, they should probably face their parent body. 'Off' should display the image exactly. They should also be able to be rotated to face another arbitrary body.
- @danielmartin0: Support for 'starmap_icons' field.
- Fix icon sizing bug in technology_icons_planet_cargo_drops?

## Minor

- Provide more screenshots for the mod portal.
